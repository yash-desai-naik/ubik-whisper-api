Now I understand better how we can leverage Supabase's capabilities for our production use case. Let me analyze our current implementation and suggest improvements using Supabase's features:

Current Implementation Analysis
Looking at your codebase, you're already using Supabase for:

Database storage (transcriptions and summaries tables)
File storage for audio files
However, the processing of transcriptions and summarizations is happening synchronously within the FastAPI request lifecycle, which can lead to timeouts and resource constraints with high user loads.

Production-Ready Improvements Using Supabase
Here's how we can make the system production-ready for 10,000+ users with large audio files:

1. Use Supabase Edge Functions with Background Tasks
Supabase Edge Functions can handle background processing outside the request-response cycle. This is perfect for our transcription and summarization workloads:

typescript
CopyInsert
// Example of how a Supabase Edge Function would work
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  // Parse the request
  const { audioFileUrl, transcriptionId } = await req.json();
  
  // Start background task for processing
  EdgeRuntime.waitUntil(processAudioFile(audioFileUrl, transcriptionId));
  
  // Return immediately to client
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    status: "processing", 
    id: transcriptionId 
  }), { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } });
});

async function processAudioFile(audioFileUrl, transcriptionId) {
  // Long-running transcription logic here
  // Update database as processing progresses
}
2. Implement a Job Queue System with Supabase Database
We can use Supabase's database to implement a simple but effective job queue:

Create a jobs table with status tracking
Use database triggers to initiate processing
Implement a polling mechanism to check job status
3. Optimize File Storage and Processing
Supabase Storage combined with Edge Functions' ephemeral storage can help with file processing:

Use client-side compression before upload (as you're already doing)
Process files in smaller chunks using ephemeral storage in Edge Functions
Store results back in Supabase Storage
4. Implement Rate Limiting and Quotas
To handle 10,000+ users:

Add rate limiting at the API level
Implement user quotas based on subscription tiers
Use Supabase Auth for user management and quota enforcement
5. Enhance Error Handling and Monitoring
Implement comprehensive error tracking
Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
Set up monitoring and alerting
Implementation Plan
Here's a step-by-step plan to enhance your current system:

Migrate Processing Logic to Edge Functions:
Create Edge Functions for transcription and summarization
Use background tasks for long-running processes
Update your FastAPI endpoints to trigger these functions
Enhance the Job Queue:
Modify your existing tables to better track job status
Add more detailed progress tracking
Implement priority queues for different user tiers
Optimize File Handling:
Implement server-side chunking for very large files
Use ephemeral storage for intermediate processing
Add more robust file validation
Add Scalability Features:
Implement rate limiting
Add user quotas
Set up proper caching
This approach leverages Supabase's capabilities while making your system more robust for production use with many concurrent users and large audio files.

Would you like me to help implement any specific part of this plan? I can start by showing you how to migrate the transcription logic to a Supabase Edge Function with background processing.
